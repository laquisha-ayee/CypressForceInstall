I was trying to get cypress installed but keep getting caught in a loop cypress would install,
yet when I tried to run my npm test it would be unable to run the npm test.
cypress was creating issues.
I found this error calld a SIGTRAP error.
These commands ran in your vs terminal can help issues 
related to deeper system dependency conflicts.
Here are the steps I used to trouble shoot this:

  1. Update node.js and npm: helps ensure you are using the latest version of node.js & npm.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm

 
  2.Clear node modules and reinstall: remove node-modules directory and 
reinstall all dependencies.

rm -rf node_modules
npm install

 
  3.Run cypress with debugging: try running cypress with additional 
debugging information to get more insights:

DEBUG=cypress:* npx cypress verify

 
  4.Check fpr cpnflicting software: sometimes, other installed software can cause conflicts. 
ensure there are no other versions of cypress or relates dependencies installed.

  5.Reinstall cypress with a different directory: try reinstalling cypress in a completely
new directory.

mkdir new-cypress-project2
cd new-cypress-project2
npm init -y
npm install cypress@14.0.0 --save-dev
npx cypress verify


I ran these in my terminal and voila! I was able to successfully run an npm test!
I hope this helps!
